      <h2>John</h2>

      <p>John is our Founder and CEO. He looks after all of those management jobs like “strategy”, “vision” and “lunch”. His task is to make sure that gloudio can grow in the right way, at the right pace and to a standard that our customers are worthy of.</p>

      <p>His career has mainly been in finance, across a spectrum of institutions. The less said about this the better.</p>

      <p>A keen tourist himself, John’s travels have seen him trek to the two highest peaks in Africa and run four of the six marathon majors. He holds a BA in Politics & International Relations from the University of Cambridge.</p>
