        <h2>John</h2>

        <p>John is our Founder and CEO. He looks after all of those management jobs like “strategy”, “vision” and “lunch”. His task is to make sure that gloudio can grow in the right way, at the right pace and to a standard that our customers are worthy of.</p>

        <p>His career has mainly been in finance, across a spectrum of institutions. The less said about this the better.</p>

        <p>A keen tourist himself, John’s travels have seen him trek to the two highest peaks in Africa and run four of the six marathon majors. He holds a BA in Politics & International Relations from the University of Cambridge.</p>

        <h2>Clare</h2>
        <p>Clare is gloudio’s Creative Strategist. She heads up market research and dabbles in a little bit of communications and product design. Researching London’s tourist market means that she has gained encyclopaedic knowledge of London’s tourist spots (just ask her what they use to pickle animals at the Natural History Museum).</p>

        <p>Prior to joining gloudio, Clare worked as a policy analyst for InLine Policy and in communications at TransferWise.</p>

        <p>She holds a BA in Politics & International Relations from the University of Cambridge.</p>

        <img src="assets/img/jav.jpg">
        <h2>Javid</h2>
        <p>Jav is Head of Content Development at gloudio. He coordinates the research, creation and production of our audio guides. He loves his guides so much that he spends many of his days off walking around London listening to them. Or maybe that’s just because he loves the sound of his own voice.</p>

        <p>Before joining gloudio, Jav spent many years working in investment banking. He is still undergoing counselling for this prolonged trauma.</p>

        <p>He holds a BA in Economics from the University of Nottingham.</p>
